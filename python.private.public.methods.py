In Python, access control for class methods (private, public, protected) is achieved through naming conventions rather than enforced restrictions. 
The standard Python libraries that help define public and private methods include:

1. Built-in Naming Conventions (No Additional Library Needed)

Python does not have strict private/public access modifiers like C++ or Java. Instead, it uses naming conventions:

Public Methods: No underscore prefix (e.g., def my_method(self):).
Protected Methods: Single underscore _my_method(self), indicating it‚Äôs intended for internal use but not enforced.
Private Methods: Double underscore __my_method(self), which triggers name mangling.

print('''About Metaclasses :

What is a Metaclass in Python?
A metaclass is a special kind of class that defines how other classes behave. In other words, a metaclass is a class for classes.

Key Concept
In Python, everything is an object, including classes.

A class is an instance of a metaclass (just like an object is an instance of a class).
By default, Python classes are created using type, which is the built-in metaclass.
Metaclasses allow modifying class behavior at creation time.

An abstract class method is a method that is declared but contains no implementation.

Protected members of a class are accessible from within the class and are also available to its sub-classes. 
No other environment is permitted access to it. This enables specific resources of the parent class to be inherited by the child class.

Python's convention to make an instance variable protected is to add a prefix _ (single underscore) to it. 
This effectively prevents it from being accessed unless it is from within a sub-class.

# Example: Access Protected Members Copy

print('''Private Members :

Python doesn't have any mechanism that effectively restricts access to any instance variable or method. 
Python prescribes a convention of prefixing the name of the variable/method with a single or double underscore 
to emulate the behavior of protected and private access specifiers.

The double underscore __ prefixed to a variable makes it private. 
It gives a strong suggestion not to touch it from outside the class. 
Any attempt to do so will result in an AttributeError.

Method Overloading:

Method overloading is a feature in Python that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters. 
This feature helps to provide flexibility and reusability to the code design. 
It is different from method overriding that allows a subclass to provide its implementation of a method defined in its superclass.

Python Getter and Setter Methods

Python offers getter and setter convenience methods to control access to the private instance variables for classes. 

The getter and setter methods are important because without them, 
the private instance variables would not be accessible outside of the class.

Getter method allows to access the value of a private instance variable from outside a class, 
and the setter method allows to set the value of a private instance variable from outside a class.
